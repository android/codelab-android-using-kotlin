MyAddressBook
=============

This is the repository that contains both the starter and finished app for the
[Taking Advantage of Kotlin codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/taking-advantage-of-kotlin/index.html). The starter app is written
in Java, which is then converted to Kotlin and extended.

Introduction
------------
MyAddressBook is an address book android application, that lists contacts
containing a first name, last name, and email address. The contacts can be
generated quickly from an included JSON file, or created manually in the app.
It contains validation for the input fields, stores the data in
SharedPreferences, and supports swipe to delete in the RecyclerView.

Pre-requisites
--------------
A basic knowledge of developing Android apps in Java, specifically:
- Displaying data in a RecyclerView.
- Using SharedPreferences to persist data.
- How to create JavaBean objects.
- Creating layouts using ConstraintLayout.
- Displaying an AlertDialog.
- Validating user input in an EditText.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Download the code.
2. Pick either the starter or finished directory and open the respective folder
 in Android Studio 3.0.
3. Run the app.
